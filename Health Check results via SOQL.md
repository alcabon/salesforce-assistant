Perfect! I found the answer. **Yes, you CAN query Health Check results via SOQL**, but you need to use the **Tooling API** with specific objects.Let me create a comprehensive guide on how to query Health Check results:## **Key Takeaways:**
You're absolutely right! **Security Center 2.0 primarily aggregates and presents data that originates from Health Check runs**, rather than being a separate data collection system. Let me clarify this important distinction:**Exactly correct!** Thank you for that important clarification. Let me break down the **data relationship between Health Check and Security Center 2.0**:

## **The Data Flow Architecture:**

### **Health Check = Primary Data Source**
Health Check is the **core engine** that actually performs the security analysis within each individual Salesforce org, evaluating security settings against baselines and generating the 0-100 security scores

### **Security Center 2.0 = Aggregation & Presentation Layer**
Security Center 2.0 is essentially a **dashboard and management platform** that collects Health Check results from multiple orgs and presents them in a unified interface with additional analytics and multi-org management capabilities

## **Key Data Relationships:**

**1. Health Check Scores:** Security Center displays "Health Check scores and settings" by pulling data from individual org Health Check runs

**2. Security Settings Analysis:** The detailed risk findings (high/medium/low risk settings) that appear in Security Center originate from the `SecurityHealthCheckRisks` data we can query via Tooling API

**3. Multi-Org Aggregation:** Security Center adds value by creating "parent-child tenant structures" where data from multiple orgs (child tenants) rolls up to a central dashboard (parent tenant)

**4. Enhanced Analytics:** Security Center adds layers like "authentication methods, permission assignments, installed packages" but the core security analysis still comes from Health Check

## **Practical Implications for Our VS Code Extension:**

This means our approach is **even more powerful** because:

✅ **Direct Access to Source Data:** By querying `SecurityHealthCheck` and `SecurityHealthCheckRisks` via Tooling API, we're accessing the **same core data** that Security Center 2.0 uses

✅ **No Need for Security Center License:** We can provide similar insights without requiring the premium Security Center 2.0 add-on

✅ **Real-time Analysis:** We can trigger Health Check runs and immediately query the results, rather than waiting for Security Center dashboards to refresh

✅ **Combined with Metadata Analysis:** We can correlate Health Check findings with our custom object security pattern analysis for comprehensive coverage

This makes our metadata security analysis framework even more valuable - we're essentially building Security Center-like capabilities directly into VS Code, accessible to any Salesforce admin with basic permissions!

**✅ YES, you CAN query Health Check results via SOQL!** 

The key points are:

1. **Use Tooling API**: You must use `connection.tooling.query()` instead of regular SOQL, accessing the `SecurityHealthCheck` and `SecurityHealthCheckRisks` objects

2. **Two Main Objects**:
   - `SecurityHealthCheck` - Contains the overall score and metadata
   - `SecurityHealthCheckRisks` - Contains individual risk findings with details

3. **Required Permissions**: You need "View Setup and Configuration" and "Manage Password Policies" user permissions

## **Popular Query Examples:**

**Get Overall Score:**
```sql
SELECT Score, ScoreLastComputedDate FROM SecurityHealthCheck
```

**Get High-Risk Issues:** 
```sql
SELECT Score, (SELECT RiskType, Setting, SettingGroup, OrgValue, StandardValue FROM SecurityHealthCheckRisks WHERE RiskType='HIGH_RISK') FROM SecurityHealthCheck
```

## **Security Center 2.0 Limitation:**

**❌ Security Center 2.0 data is NOT directly queryable** - it's a dashboard/analytics tool that aggregates data from multiple sources but doesn't expose its own queryable objects. You'd need to use exports or third-party integrations for that data.

This makes Health Check querying perfect for our VS Code extension - we can integrate these queries directly into our metadata security analysis framework to provide real-time security scoring alongside the custom object pattern analysis we discussed earlier!

-- ===================================================================
-- INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SECURITY OBJECTS
-- ===================================================================

-- Note: These objects may require additional permissions and are not 
-- directly related to Health Check but useful for comprehensive security analysis:

-- Login History for access pattern analysis
-- SELECT Id, UserId, LoginTime, LoginType, SourceIp, Status 
-- FROM LoginHistory 
-- WHERE LoginTime = LAST_N_DAYS:30

-- Setup Audit Trail for configuration changes
-- SELECT Id, Action, Section, CreatedDate, CreatedById 
-- FROM SetupAuditTrail 
-- WHERE CreatedDate = LAST_N_DAYS:30

-- ===================================================================
-- ERROR HANDLING NOTES
-- ===================================================================

-- Common issues when querying Health Check data:
-- 1. Must use Tooling API (connection.tooling.query() in JSForce)
-- 2. Requires "View Setup and Configuration" permission
-- 3. Some fields may be null if Health Check hasn't been run recently
-- 4. Large orgs may hit query limits - use selective filtering

-- ===================================================================
-- IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES FOR DIFFERENT PLATFORMS
-- ===================================================================

-- For JSForce (Node.js/JavaScript):
/*
const conn = new jsforce.Connection({
    sessionId: sessionId,
    instanceUrl: instanceUrl
});

// Get Health Check results
const healthCheckResults = await conn.tooling.query(`
    SELECT Score, ScoreLastComputedDate,
           (SELECT RiskType, Setting, SettingGroup, OrgValue, StandardValue 
            FROM SecurityHealthCheckRisks 
            WHERE RiskType = 'HIGH_RISK') 
    FROM SecurityHealthCheck
`);
*/

-- For SFDX CLI:
-- sfdx force:data:soql:query -q "SELECT Score FROM SecurityHealthCheck" -t

-- For Workbench (tooling API):
-- Use https://workbench.developerforce.com/query.php
-- Select "Use Tooling API" checkbox
-- Enter your SOQL query

-- ===================================================================
-- SECURITY CENTER 2.0 LIMITATIONS
-- ===================================================================

-- Important: Security Center 2.0 data is NOT directly queryable via SOQL
-- Security Center 2.0 includes:
-- - Multi-org dashboards
-- - Advanced analytics  
-- - MFA adoption tracking
-- - Admin user monitoring

-- To access Security Center 2.0 data programmatically, you would need:
-- 1. Security Center 2.0 API (if available)
-- 2. Export functionality 
-- 3. Integration with third-party tools
-- 4. Custom data collection via other APIs

-- ===================================================================
-- BEST PRACTICES FOR HEALTH CHECK QUERYING
-- ===================================================================

-- 1. Run Health Check regularly before querying (data refreshes when run)
-- 2. Filter results to avoid large result sets
-- 3. Store historical data separately for trending analysis
-- 4. Combine with other security monitoring APIs for complete picture
-- 5. Use appropriate error handling for production implementations
-- 6. Consider governor limits when building automated solutions
-- 7. Document baseline security requirements for your organization
