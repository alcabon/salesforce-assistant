## 🎯 **The Ambitious Vision**

Transform how Salesforce administrators and security professionals approach metadata security analysis by bringing **enterprise-grade security intelligence directly into VS Code**. This extension represents a paradigm shift from manual, time-intensive security reviews to **automated, AI-powered, real-time security analysis** at unprecedented scale.

### **What We're Building**
- **Universal Security Scanner**: Analyze any Salesforce org from small developer sandboxes to massive enterprise deployments
- **Intelligent Pattern Recognition**: AI-powered detection of security vulnerabilities in custom objects, fields, flows, and configurations  
- **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Live security scoring integrated with Salesforce Health Check APIs
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle orgs with 50,000+ metadata components without breaking a sweat
- **Zero-Config Authentication**: Seamless integration with SF CLI for frictionless security analysis
